### kalen's steps:
- assuming we have chord numbers
1. choose bass notes based on chords:
   1. prefer giving bass the root
   2. check for parallel 5ths and 8ves
   3. if repairs necessary, prefer stepwise
   4. avoid notes from tritone (if chord is viio, or dom7)
   5. dont repeat notes
   6. jumps ok
___________________

between 2 voices:
1. avoid crossed voices (except alto and tenor can cross briefly if necessary)
2. avoid overly spacious sonorities - adjacent voices within an octave
3. avoid parallel & contrary 5th and 8ves
4. avoid direct 5th and 8ves in outer parts (with leap in soprano, leap or step in bass)
these apply to all voices:
5. forbidden melodic intervals: 7th, more than 8ve, tritone, augmented
6. intervals requiring change of direction: diminished, anything larger than P5
7. consecutive leaps in same direction should outline a triad

triads/bass:
1. almost always use complete triads (code: always use complete, except at cadence)
2. if using incomplete triads, root and third
3. 2nd inversion is kind of dissonant (lenient). but there are some exceptions, e.g. cadential 6-4, neighbor 6-4 (I IV6-4 I)
4. begin and end phrases with root position triads
5. use root position 2/3 of the time
- theory: if you have parallel 5th or 8ve w/ bass in root position, you shouldn't have problems in 1st inversion, changing one or both bass notes
6. first inversion triad 1/3 of the time: maybe to repair root position. dude says use to connect by step to the note before or after, or arpeggiation

cadences:
1. 2 voices move by contrary step to unison or 8ve, one of these pitches must be in final chord bass
2. penultimate chord must be complete triad

how to handle embellishments?
- ex case: first inversion only works with a passing tone in bass, but sounds better with that than root.
- first pass: only use first inversion when absolutely necessary (avoid parallels)
- second pass: embellishments not only include passing tones, but also changing inversions from 0 to 1


### this is the weird 3+1 method

3+1 for closed position
- treat the upper 3 voices as a triad in closed position
- if the upper 3 voices are a root position triad, they cannot move to another root position triad
- move bass in contrary motion to upper voices (or just check for parallels)

3+1 for open position
- transpose middle of the 3 down an octave to get open position (A/T switch)
- 2 disallowed moves: root to root, 1st inv to 1st inv

embellishments
- swap bass and tenor and change octaves

half-open chords:
- upper voices do not complete triad, so bass must complete chord
- cannot have 2 half-open chords in a row
- half-open/close cannot create parallels
- half-open/open: need to look at P5 in the half-open chord

open to/from close:
- only need to check parallels with the bass
