rules we already incorporated (strict short term rules)
- final approached by step
- permitted melodic intervals
- begin and end on perfect consonance
- no parallel/direct perfects
- stay w/in 10th of cf
- begin/end on 1st/8ve, if cpt above, can start on 5th
- no unisons except begin/end
- avoid parallel/hidden fifths/octaves, no parallel 4ths
- no similar skips
- avoid dissonant harmonic intervals

strict long term rules
- * if there are 2 skips in same direction, second must be smaller than first
- * if there are 2 skips in same direction, larger interval must be consonant
- * if there are 2 skips in same direction, 3 notes should be from the same triad or should not outline more than an octave
- no interval of tritone and 7th in 3 melodic notes
- must have unique global max, not on first or last note
- from any local min to any local max (or vice versa), the interval cannot be 7th
- do not use an interval 4+ times in a row

lenient short term rules
- contrary motion should DOMINATE

lenient long term rules
- avoid writing 2 skips in same direction (but if you do, see *)
- follow skip in opposite direction
- climax should be near middle
